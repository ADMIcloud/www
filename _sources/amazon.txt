Using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
=========================================


The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is public Cloud infrastructure and a central part of the Amazon Web Services offering. Amazon EC2  allows users to run Virtual Machines in an on-demand way, and run their own software and computer applications as if they were owned by the users directly. the EC2 Cloud also enables users to create scalable internet applications and distributed systems with multiple virtual machines. 

In EC2, an instance is a running and deployed virtual machine in the cloud. Instances can include any software the user directed, and is uaually based on a pre-existing virtual machine image, saved in EC2. Users can create, stop, and terminate instances at will, and are charged per hour of runtime. 

EC2 in the Cloud Workshop
---------------------------

This workshop will rely extensively on the use of Amazon EC2 for computing services and deployed software. Specifically, all of the workshop software and tutorials have been built into a publicly available EC2 image for use not only in the workshop, but also afterwards. To speed up the workshop, VM instances have already been booted and prepared for you and login credentials will be distributed upon arrival.



Logging into EC2 Instance
--------------------------

You will be assigned your own personal VM instance via a piece of paper. This will include two things: a  IP address and a unique password.  From here, you will log into the VM via SSH.
